    <h1>International Cricket Council</h1>
    <p>
    The <b><i>International Cricket Council (ICC)</i></b> is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from Australia, England and South Africa. It was renamed as the International Cricket Conference in 1965, and took up its current name in 1989.<br>

The ICC has <b><i>105 members</i></b>: <b><i>12 Full Members</i></b> that play Test matches and 93 Associate Members. The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, most notably the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals. It promulgates the ICC Code of Conduct, which sets professional standards of discipline for international cricket, and also co-ordinates action against corruption and match-fixing through its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU).<br>

The ICC does not control bilateral fixtures between member countries (which include all Test matches), it does not govern domestic cricket in member countries, and it does not make the laws of the game, which remain under the control of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

The Chairman heads the board of directors and on <b><i>26 June 2014</i></b>, N.Srinivasan, the former president of BCCI, was announced as the first chairman of the council. The role of ICC president has become a largely honorary position since the establishment of the chairman role and other changes were made to the ICC constitution in 2014. It has been claimed that the 2014 changes have handed control to the so-called 'Big Three' nations of <b><i> England</i></b>, India and Australia. The last ICC president was Zaheer Abbas, who was appointed in June 2015 following the resignation of Mustafa Kamal in April 2015. The post of ICC president was abolished in April 2016 and Shashank Manohar who replaced Mr. Srinivasan in October 2015 became the first independent chairman of the ICC since then. The current CEO is <b><i>Manu Sawhney</i></b>,the former CEO of Singapore Sports Hub and Managing Director of ESPN Star Sports (ESS)

    <h1>Cricket Boards</h1>
    <p>The game of cricket is probably played by not too many countries, but because of its huge popularity among the Asian and especially among the sub-continental countries the amount of fan following is huge. Because the game of cricket is huge there it is bound for all those host cricket boards along with the other most richest cricket boards of the world, to earn a good chunk of money.</p>

    The New Zealand Cricket board is standing at the bottom of the list as cricket is the second popular game in the country after Rugby. Although the Kiwi cricketers do earn a lot because of playing in many T20 leagues across the world, the cricket board is still struggling to earn big like other cricket boards.The New Zealand cricket team became known as the Black Caps in January 1998, after its sponsor at the time, Clear Communications, held a competition to choose a name for the team. Official New Zealand Cricket sources typeset the nickname as BLACKCAPS. This is one of many national team nicknames related to the All Blacks.As of 12 March 2019, New Zealand have played 1309 Internationals, winning 496, losing 594, tying 11 and drawing 165 matches while 43 matches ended yeilding no result. The team is ranked 2nd in Tests, 3rd in ODIs and 6th in T20Is by the ICC.On 27 December 1894, 12 delegates from around New Zealand met in Christchurch to form the New Zealand Cricket Council. Heathcote Williams was elected the inaugural president, and Charles Smith the secretary.

    Actually, the West Indies Cricket Board is a combination of many Caribbean cricket playing nations. Since early 1900s different Caribbean countries playing as one team and had some fantastic time on the international cricket arena from 1970s to mid-1990s but since then soccer and other American sports have taken over the imagination of the youth there. Cricket is still alive there but not as it was in the past, hence WICB is also struggling to earn lots of money. But there is a hope. Just last year a franchise based Caribbean Cricket League has been established and it has become an instant hit, hopefully that will attract more and more people to reconnect with the game.Cricket West Indies (CWI), formerly known as West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), is the governing body for cricket in the West Indies (a sporting confederation of over a dozen mainly English-speaking Caribbean countries and dependencies that once formed the British West Indies).The President of CWI is Whycliffe "Dave" Cameron (since 27 March 2013, formerly Vice-President to and replacing Dr. Julian Hunte) and Johnny Grave is the Chief Executive Officer.

With the Australian Cricket Team doing consistently well and cricket still remains the focus of the people there Cricket Australia doesn’t have to worry too much about the money. With lucrative KFC T20 Bash league Cricket Australia can certainly look forward.Sri Lanka's national cricket team achieved considerable success beginning in the 1990s, rising from underdog status to winning the Cricket World Cup in 1996. Since then, the team has continued to be a force in international cricket. The Sri Lankan cricket team reached the finals of the 2007 and 2011 Cricket World Cups consecutively. They ended up being runners up on both occasions.Sri Lanka have won the Cricket World Cup in 1996, the ICC Champions Trophy in 2002 (co-champions with India), and have won the ICC T20 World Cup in 2014. They have been consecutive runners up in the 2007 and 2011 Cricket World Cups, and have been runners up in the ICC T20 World Cup in 2009 and 2012.

    Despite the country has been badly hit by terrorism, despite the team has to play their ‘home games’ outside and despite the board has been running ad hoc for last so many years, the PCB seems to be doing well on the economic front. Maybe because the fan following it has and hence the television rights and frequent foreign tour guarantee money are the reasons for their fair enough position. Pakistan has played 423 Test matches, winning 136, losing 128 and drawing 159. Pakistan was given Test status on 28 July 1952, following a recommendation by India, and made its Test debut against India at Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, Delhi, in October 1952, with India winning by an innings and 70 runs. In the 1930s and 40s, several Pakistani Test players had played Test cricket for the Indian cricket team before the creation of Pakistan in 1947.In the past, Pakistan has suffered a lot from terrorism which prevented foreign teams from visiting Pakistan primarily due to the 2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team.

Since 1997 it has been governed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), having been previously governed by Marylebone Cricket Club (the MCC) from 1903 until the end of 1996. England, as a founding nation, is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status. Until the 1990s, Scottish and Irish players also played for England as those countries were not yet ICC members in their own right.England and Australia were the first teams to play a Test match (between 15–19 March 1877), and these two countries together with South Africa formed the Imperial Cricket Conference (predecessor to today's International Cricket Council) on 15 June 1909.

    Despite earning so much Cricket South Africa is spending more than what they are earning, hence they are actually making losses. They are hugely dependent on television rights and teams touring their country more frequently than not. But the team is doing good and that is a good news for them.The South African national cricket team, nicknamed the Proteas (after South Africa's national flower, Protea cynaroides, commonly known as the "king protea"), is administered by Cricket South Africa. South Africa is a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) status.The ban remained in place until 1991 and South Africa could then play against India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies for the first time. The team since reinstatement has mostly been strong and has at times held number one positions in international rankings but has lacked success in organised tournaments.

There was a period when BCCI was not even able to pay their cricketers on time, but since India’s win of the 1983 world cup changed the fortunes of the Indian cricket. The big moment came when in 2008 the Indian Premier League or IPL started and the BCCI started to mint more money. With the passionate public behind them BCCI today even ruling the cricket world as a de fact of cricketing body of the ICC.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the national governing body for cricket in India. The board was formed in December 1928 as a society, registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act. It is a consortium of state cricket associations and the state associations select their representatives who in turn elect the BCCI Chief. It's headquarters are in Wankhede Stadium , Mumbai. C.K.

    <h1>Pitches and  their  effect  on  bowling  in the game   of cricket</h1>
    <p>
        In the game of cricket, the cricket pitch consists of the central strip of the cricket field between the wickets. It is <b><i>22 yards (20.12 m)</i></b> long and 10 feet (3.05 m) wide. The surface is flat and normally covered with extremely short grass though this grass is soon removed by wear at the ends of the pitch.<br>

In amateur matches in some parts of the world, artificial pitches are sometimes used. These can be a slab of concrete overlaid with a coir mat or artificial turf. sometimes dirt is put over the coir mat to provide an authentic feeling pitch. Artificial pitches are rare in professional cricket, being used only when exhibition matches are played in regions where cricket is not a common sport.

The pitch has specific markings delineating the creases, as specified by the Laws of Cricket.<br><br>
        <img src="pitch.jpg" height="245px" width="550px" style="margin-left: 400px;"><br><br><br>

The word wicket often occurs in reference to the pitch. Although technically incorrect according to the Laws of Cricket (Law 6 covers the pitch and Law 8 the wickets, distinguishing between them), cricket players, followers, and commentators persist in the usage, with context eliminating any possible ambiguity. Track is yet another synonym for pitch.

The rectangular central area of the cricket field – the space used for pitches – is known as the square. Cricket pitches are usually oriented as close to the north-south direction as practical, because the low afternoon sun would be dangerous for a batsman facing due west.
     It is just the track on which the ‘bowler’ throws the ball with a straight arm which can bend to the maximum by 15 degrees to the ‘batsman’ who would basically try to hit the ball to boundary of the ground and also take care that the ‘stumps' (which is behind him by few feets) remains intact in its place.<br>
        In the<b><i> 500 years</i></b> of cricket, it is believed that the pitch plays a major part in assisting the bowler.<br><br> There are basically three types of bowlers which have legitimate bowling action to bowl in a cricket match. They are :</p>
    
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc; color:darkred; font-size:25px;">
           <li><b><i>Fast Bowler:</i></b> They are the ‘fire of cricket'. There pace is their key. They can trick the opponent with their pace. If swing is provided, they can be very lethal.</li> 
            <li><b><i>Medium Pacer:</i></b> They lack pace in their bowling. Their skill is the weapon for them. They can swing the ball. They can create a deviation in the ball which can deceive the batsman to take their wicket.</li>
            <li><b><i>Spinners:</i></b> They are ones who maintains the balance between bat and ball in cricket. They have mastered the trick to turn the ball. On their day, they can ‘turn’ the tide in the favour of their team.</li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Types of Cricket Pitches</h2>
    <h3>Dusty Pitches</h3>
    <p>
    A dusty pitch is dressed in loose clay or sand, which helps the spinners get a good amount of spin and bounce from the pitches. These types of pitches are generally formed when the pitch is not rolled properly.
    </p>
    <h3>Green Tops</h3>
    <p>
    Theses assist pacers by providing them with ample swing and seam movement from the turf. Playing on a green cricket pitch is a challenge for even the best of the batsmen as they have to judge the movement of the ball after pitching in a short time. The matches played on these cricket pitches are generally low scoring.
    </p>
    <h3>Dead Pitches</h3>
    <p>
    These pitches don’t offer any help to pacers or spinners and are used in high scoring matches. Often used in T20 cricket, these pitches favour the batsmen for the whole game.
    </p>
    <h1>Batting Area In Cricket</h1>
    <p>
    Batting is one of the central aspects of the sport of cricket. It may look simple, but becoming a competent batsman requires lots of hard work. Take some time to really dial in your stance, grip, and swing, along with other basic cues. When it comes time to take to the pitch, watch the bowler closely to try to predict his angle of delivery and keep your eye on the ball until you make contact. With enough practice, you can score more runs and take your game to the next level.
    </p>
    <h2>How to Improve Your Batting in Cricket</h2>
    <h3> 1.  Getting into Position</h3>
    <p>
        <img src="batting1.jpg" height="215px" width="550px" style="margin-left: 400px;"><br><br>
    
   <b><i> Take a firm grip on the bat with both hands.    </i></b> Wrap both hands around the handle of the bat with your dominant hand closest to the blade. For maximum control and precision, place your hands somewhere between the middle and top of the handle and keep them close enough together for the space between the thumb of your upper hand and the forefinger of your lower hand to form a 'V' shape.<br><br>
        -> The further away you place your hands on the handle, the more awkward maneuvering the bat will become.<br><br>
<img src="batting2.jpg" height="215px" width="550px" style="margin-left: 400px;"><br><br>
<b><i>Assume a comfortable stance.   </i></b>Most batsmen prefer a side-on stance. If you’re right-handed, turn your left side toward the bowler with the bat off to your right side. If you’re left-handed, simply reverse this position. Plant your feet about shoulder width and put a little bend in your knees. Keep your weight distributed evenly on the balls of your feet.<br><br>
        -> Once you’re in a basic side-on stance, angle your feet or upper body to get into a position that feels more natural.<br>
        -> There’s no single best batting stance for cricket. The important thing is that you choose a stance that offers maximum stability and leverage so you can hit with more force.<br>
        -> Be prepared to tweak your stance during games to adapt to different shots. If the bowler delivers a bouncer just in front of your feet, for instance, you'll need to be ready to shift your weight and play a cut       off your back foot.<br><br>
         <img src="batting3.jpg" height="215px" width="550px" style="margin-left: 400px;"><br><br>
        <b><i>Chamber the bat at waist height until it’s time to swing.   </i></b>Hold the bat out to the side so that it's parallel with the ground, or keep it pointed up or down at a slight angle. The exact position of the bat doesn't matter as long as you're able to move it quickly and easily to initiate your swing.<br><br>
        -> Make sure you’re holding the bat with the flat side facing the bowler.<br>
        -> Since most bowls tend to be delivered closer to ground level, a cricket bat shouldn't be held as high as a baseball bat.<br>

    <h3> 2.   Delivering a Proper Swing</h3><br>

        <b><i>Begin lifting the bat as the bowler delivers the ball. </i></b> Bring the bat up and back until it’s hovering just below shoulder height. From here, you’ll be able to move forward or backward while making sure the bat stays in the ready position. Keep your elbows bent and your shoulders relaxed but ready to strike.<br>
        -> If you wait until the bowler releases the ball to start pulling back, you won’t be able to reverse the motion of the bat in time to make contact at the optimal distance.<br>
        -> Avoid raising the bat at too much of an angle, as this can throw off the accuracy of your swing.<br><br>

        <b><i>Swing the bat straight up to meet the ball. </i></b> Quickly bring the bat back across your body with the blade perpendicular to the ground or at a horizontal angle. Make an effort to strike the ball as close to the center of the bat as possible. This is the basic technique used for most basic shots, including drives and defensive hits.<br><br>
        -> Watch the ball closely as it crosses the pitch to determine which type of shot you'll need to play.<br>
        -> The batting action in cricket has more in common with a tight, controlled golf swing than the wide, horizontal arc of a baseball bat.<br><br>

     <b><i>   Follow through to get more distance on your shot.</i></b> As you make contact, twist your hips and open up your chest in the direction of your swing. Continue driving the bat upwards without taking your non-dominant hand off the handle. A smooth, well-timed rotation will generate more momentum, sending the ball further.<br>
        -> An exaggerated follow through is most useful for hitting drives, and may not be necessary when you're just trying to prevent the ball from making it to the wicket.<br><br>
