    <h1>Greatest Cricketers</h1>
    <p>If cricket is a religion then there are many Gods. Cricket unites individuals better than any religion can ever do. With millions of ardent followers, cricket is the one of the most celebrated sports in the world.The history of cricket started hundreds of years ago during the 16th century. The game originated in southern England but today has gained worldwide popularity.Cricket started hundreds of years ago during the 16th century. The game originated in southern England but today is popular in Australia, England, the Indian subcontinent, the West Indies, and Southern Africa.Competitive cricket is essentially a bat and ball sport. It is played by two teams on an oval and involves batting, fielding and bowling. There are 11 players a side and a game can last anywhere from several hours to several days.Cricket can be played both socially and competitively, by males and females of all ages. While competitive cricket is mostly played on a field, cricket just for fun can be played in backyards, parks, streets or on the beach. You only need a couple of friends, a bat, a ball and something that represents wickets.   Since its early days cricket has produced numerous renowned and legendary players. Today we’re going to take a look at the top 10 greatest cricketers of all time:</p>

    Sir Donald George “Don” Bradman, often referred to as “The Don”, was an Australian cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. Bradman’s career Test batting average of 99.94 is often cited as statistically the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport. Bradman held a lot of batting records, such as the most double centuries and the highest score in test cricket for many years before some of these records were eventually broken. However, he still holds the record for the highest average in test cricket history. A record that many experts believe will never be broken.When Bradman retired from test cricket in 1948 he had scored 6,996 runs in 52 tests with 29 centuries and 13 fifties at a staggering average of 99.94!.During a 20-year playing career, Bradman consistently scored at a level that made him, in the words of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull, "worth three batsmen to Australia".

    Sachin Tendulkar is considered one of the greatest batsmen in the history of his sport. No player has ever enjoyed the level of fandom that Sachin did and after retirement also nothing has changed. In 2012, he became the first player to score 100 international tons besides being miles ahead in terms of runs scored in Tests and ODIs. He was also the first player to break the double-hundred barrier in ODIs in 2008 when he achieved the unthinkable in Gwalior against South Africa.In 2008, he reached another major milestone by surpassing Brian Lara’s mark of 11,953 Test runs. Tendulkar took home the World Cup with his team in 2011, and wrapped up his record-breaking career in 2013.  After a few hours of his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister’s Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award.His talent and achievements consistent over more than two decades made him a giant of a player, and even years after quitting the game he remains India’s favorite son.He is the highest run scorer of all time in International cricket.

    Imran Khan is indisputably the greatest cricketer to emerge from Pakistan, and arguably the world’s second-best all-rounder after Garry Sobers. Khan served as the team’s captain intermittently throughout 1982–1992. He, notably, led Pakistan to victory at the 1992 Cricket World Cup.His averages (37 with the bat, 22 with the ball) put him at the top of the quartet of all-rounders (Ian Botham, Richard Hadlee and Kapil Dev being the others) who dominated Test cricket in the 1980s.Khan was born to an upper-middle class Pashtun family in Lahore, Punjab, in 1952; he was educated at Aitchison College in Lahore, then the Royal Grammar School Worcester in Worcester, England, and later at Keble College, Oxford. He started playing cricket at the age of 13. Initially playing for his college and later for Worcestershire, Khan made his debut for the Pakistan national cricket team at the age of 18, during the 1971 series against England at Edgbaston, Birmingham. After graduating from Oxford, he made his home debut for Pakistan in 1976, and played until 1992.

    Kapil Dev was India’s best fast bowler, best all-rounder and one of India’s best captains who will always be remembered for leading the country to the biggest thing to happen to Indian cricket: the 1983 World Cup triumph. With the ball, he was known for his energetic action and lethal out swingers which took the ball away from the right handers. With the bat, he was an aggressive lower-middle order batsman who could shift the momentum of a game in minutes. On the field, he was known for his inspirational leadership (often by example) and athletic fielding. All these qualities made him the only player in the history of the game to have taken 400 wickets and scored more than 5000 runs in Test cricket, making him one of the all-time best all-rounders of the game.Dev captained the Indian cricket team that won the 1983 Cricket World Cup. He was India's national cricket coach between October 1999 and August 2000. He retired in 1994, holding the world record for the greatest number of wickets taken in Test cricket, a record subsequently broken by Courtney Walsh in 2000.

   Viewed purely through numbers, The King of Swing Muralitharan is a giant performer and is in the unique position of holding the records for most wickets in One Day Internationals as well as Test matches. In fact, what Murali has done in bowling is akin to what Tendulkar has done in batting. He averaged 20.80 in Test matches and 21.23 in ODIs, picking up over 1000 international wickets (653 in Tests and 405 in ODIs).The spin wizard signed off Test cricket in 2010, with a wicket off his last ball, propelling his tally to 800 wickets.Muralitharan's career was beset by controversy over his bowling action for much of his international career. Due to an unusual hyperextension of his congenitally bent arm during delivery, his bowling action was called into question on a number of occasions by umpires and sections of the cricket community. After biomechanical analysis under simulated playing conditions, Muralitharan's action was cleared by the International Cricket Council, first in 1996 and again in 1999.

  Brian Charles Lara is a former Trinidadian international cricket player. He is one of the dominant ODI and test batsmen of all times. No-one since Bradman has built massive scores as often and as fast as Lara in his pomp. He is the only batsman to have ever scored a century, a double century, a triple century, a quadruple century and a quintuple century in first class games over the course of a senior career.Lara's match-winning performance of 153 not out against Australia in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1999 has been rated by Wisden as the second best batting performance in the history of Test cricket, next only to the 270 runs scored by Sir Donald Bradman in The Ashes Test match of 1937. Muttiah Muralitharan, rated as the greatest Test match bowler ever by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and the highest wicket-taker in both Test cricket and in One Day Internationals (ODIs), has hailed Lara as his toughest opponent among all batsmen in the world. Brian Lara was appointed honorary member of the Order of Australia on 27 November 2009.

Ricky Thomas Ponting – a specialist right hander from Tasmania – is the highest run getter for Australia in both Tests and ODIs and is also their most successful captain. Ricky, who made his debut in 1995, took over as the Australian ODI captain in 2002 and has been a part of three successful World Cup campaigns which also included a 34 match winning streak – a record that very few people can match.He represented the Tasmanian Tigers in Australian domestic cricket, the Hobart Hurricanes in Australia's domestic T20 competition the Big Bash League, and played in the Indian Premier League with the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2008. He is widely considered to be one of the best batsmen of the modern era, alongside Sachin Tendulkar of India and Brian Lara of the West Indies. On 1 December 2006, he reached the highest rating achieved by a Test batsman for 50 years, though this was surpassed by Steve Smith in December 2017.He stands second in the List of cricketers by number of international centuries scored behind Sachin Tendulkar.
