    <h1>Why Cricket is the Greatest Sport </h1><br>
  <h2>  Tail-End Batting</h2>
<p id="p1">Tailenders can't bat very well, but cricket still makes them do it. Which is great???<br>There are games that take more strength, more speed, ones that require a higher level of fitness, and ones that require deeper resources of endurance. But no game equals cricket in its all-round development of all the aptitudes. There are games that contain a greater concentration of excitement per playing hour. But no game approaches cricket in its blend of subtlety, entertainment, sudden thrill and sustained intellectual interest. Cricket, like no other game, takes the whole of a man - his body, soul, heart, will and wits.No other sport compares in terms of the number of skills displayed, and the blend of subtlety, entertainment, sudden thrill and sustained intellectual interest.</p>
